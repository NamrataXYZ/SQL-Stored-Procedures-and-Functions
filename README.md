# SQL-Stored-Procedures-and-Functions
This task demonstrates the use of Stored Procedures and Functions in SQL to modularize database logic. It includes examples of procedure creation with input/output parameters, conditional logic, and function creation for reusable computations.

SQL Stored Procedures and Functions – Reusable SQL Blocks
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions in SQL to modularize and reuse database logic. It includes practical examples such as retrieving employees by department, calculating bonuses, and computing total salaries with input and output parameters.

The objective is to showcase how SQL routines can improve:
 - Reusability
 - Maintainability
 - Efficiency of database operations

🛠️ Tools Used
 - MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite
 - SQL (DDL & DML)

📖 Key Concepts Covered
 - Creating Stored Procedures with IN and OUT parameters
 - Using User-defined Functions (scalar functions)
 - Applying conditional logic (IF, CASE) in procedures
 - Calling procedures and functions in SQL
 - Difference between Procedures and Functions

🎯 Learning Outcome
 - By completing this task, you will:
 - Understand the difference between procedures and functions
 - Learn how to modularize SQL logic
 - Be able to create reusable database components
